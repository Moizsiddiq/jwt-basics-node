# JWT-Basics
A Node.js authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This system includes a login endpoint to generate a JWT upon successful authentication and a protected dashboard endpoint that requires a valid JWT for access.

## Features
- User authentication using JWT
- Token generation upon successful login
- Secure access to the dashboard using a valid JWT

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- npm or yarn installed
- MongoDB for user data storage

## Usage
### Login
Send a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with the `username` and `password` in the request body.

Example using cURL:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -d '{"username": "your-username", "password": "your-password"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Dashboard
To access the dashboard, send a GET request to the `/dashboard` endpoint with the generated JWT in the Authorization header.

Example using cURL:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/dashboard -H "Authorization: Bearer your-generated-token"
```
## Security Considerations

1. **Use HTTPS in Production:**
   Always use HTTPS to secure data in transit. This ensures that the communication between the client and server is encrypted, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **Secure Storage of Sensitive Data:**
   Store sensitive information, such as the JWT secret, securely. Avoid hardcoding secrets in your code. Instead, use environment variables to manage sensitive information.

3. **Proper Validation, Error Handling, and Password Hashing:**
   Implement the following practices for enhanced security:

   - **Proper Validation:**
     Implement thorough input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks. Use libraries like `validator` to sanitize and validate user inputs.

   - **Error Handling:**
     Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in error responses. Provide generic error messages to users and log detailed errors for debugging purposes.

   - **Password Hashing:**
     When storing user passwords, use a secure password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). Never store plain-text passwords. This adds an additional layer of security in case of a data breach.

These practices contribute to a more secure authentication system by protecting data in transit, securing sensitive information, and implementing robust validation, error handling, and password protection mechanisms.
